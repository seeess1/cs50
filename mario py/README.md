# mario.py
This is my solution to the mario.py challenge in problem set 6 of Harvardâ€™s online CS50 course. mario.py creates a visual approximation of block pyramids from the early versions of Mario (like this one, for example). When the user runs mario.py, the program prompts the user for the desired height of the block pyramid. After the user enters the height of the pyramid, the program displays that pyramid using # marks. 

Earlier in the course, I created a program in C that produced the same effect. In this assignment, I translated into Python the code I had previously written in C.
