# whodunit
This is my solution to the whodunit problem in problem set 4 of Harvard’s online CS50 course. Note that almost all of the code was provided during the course. My task in this problem was to modify the code in order to reveal a hidden message contained in clue.bmp. (My modification can be found in lines 79-98.)

How to use this program: Compile whodunit and then run the program with two arguments in the command line. The user should enter clue.bmp as the first argument in the command line and the name of a bmp file as the second argument. For example, after compiling the program, the user could run “./whodunit clue.bmp solution.bmp” in the command line. The program would then create a file called solution.bmp, which will reveal the hidden message contained in clue.bmp.
